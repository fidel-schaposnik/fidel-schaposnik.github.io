I started teaching as a first-year undergraduate student in 2007, at an Euclidean Geometry course at high-school level. During the years that followed and until completing my PhD in 2016, I was a teaching assistant in various courses at _Universidad Nacional de La Plata_, within both the Physics and Mathematics departments (Calculus I & II; Physics I, II & III; General Relativity; Statistical Mechanics; Analytical Mechanics). I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and consider teaching an integral part of my personal learning experience and academic life.

Apart from university-level courses in Physics and Mathematics, I've taught several mini-courses on competitive programming at various universities throughout Latin America.
