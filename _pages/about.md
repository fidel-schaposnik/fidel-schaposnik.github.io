I am a high-energy physicist working as postdoctoral researcher at [Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques](https://www.ihes.fr/) (France), and previously at Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium) and Institute for Basic Science (South Korea). I am interested mostly in holography and low-dimensional models of quantum gravity, although I have also been known to work in condensed-matter physics, slime mold models and other interdisciplinary topics. During the last few years, I've been working on artificial intelligence for automated theorem proving with [Vasily Pestun](https://pestun.ihes.fr/). For more details, you can check out my [publications](/publications/) page or see my [full CV here](/cv/).

I have a [programming](/programming/) habit, and enjoy cooking and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25356270) (let me know if you happen to be around and want to go for a run :-)

If you came here looking for a different person chances are you are after my father, who is coincidentally also a physicist and named Fidel Schaposnik. You can check out his [website here](https://sites.google.com/site/schaposnik/), and you should also take a look at [Laura Schaposnik's website](https://lauraschaposnik.github.io), who is my sister, a Mathematician and publisher of a collection of children's books.
