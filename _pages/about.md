I am a high-energy physicist working as postdoctoral researcher at [Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques](https://www.ihes.fr/) (France), and previously at Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium) and Institute for Basic Science (South Korea). I am interested mostly in holography and low-dimensional models of quantum gravity, although I have also been known to work in condensed-matter physics, slime mold models and other interdisciplinary topics. During the last few years, I've been working on artificial intelligence for automated theorem proving with [Vasily Pestun](https://pestun.ihes.fr/). For more details, you can check out my [publications](/publications/) page or see my full CV here.

I enjoy cooking and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25356270)
