I am a high-energy physicist working as postdoctoral researcher at [Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques](https://www.ihes.fr/) (France), and previously at Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium) and Institute for Basic Science (South Korea). I am interested mostly in holography and low-dimensional models of quantum gravity, although I have also been known to work in condensed-matter physics, slime mold models and other interdisciplinary topics. During the last few years, I've been working on artificial intelligence for automated theorem proving with [Vasily Pestun](https://pestun.ihes.fr/). For more details, you can check out my [publications](/publications/) page or see my [full CV here](/cv/).

I began programming in the early 2000’s when I discovered then-little-known Python 1.6 through a family friend, and have been coding ever since – my SourceForge account is now old enough to drink! My preferred languages are [Python for machine-learning and artificial intelligence](https://github.com/fidel-schaposnik), as well as day-to-day automation; [C++ for competitive programming](/competitive_programming/); and [Mathematica for symbolic computations and Physics projects](/mathematica/).

Apart from my programming habit, I enjoy cooking and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25356270) (let me know if you happen to be around and want to go for a jog :-)

If you came here looking for a different person chances are you are after my father, who is coincidentally also a physicist and named Fidel Schaposnik. You can check out his [website here](https://sites.google.com/site/schaposnik/), and you should also take a look at [Laura Schaposnik's website](https://lauraschaposnik.github.io), who is my sister, a Mathematician and publisher of a collection of children's books.
