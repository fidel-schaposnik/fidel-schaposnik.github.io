I began programming in the early 2000's when I discovered then-little-known Python 1.6 through a family friend, and have been coding ever since -- my SourceForge account is now old enough to drink! My preferred languages are Python for machine-learning and artificial intelligence, as well as day-to-day automation; C++ for competitive programming; and Mathematica for symbolic computations and Physics projects.

This page contains various links and resources related to programming. Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you find any bugs, errors or broken links.

## Competitive programming

I started participating in the _ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest_ ([ICPC](https://icpc.global/)) in 2006, as a member of team "La JiRaFa" along with [Joaquin Rodrigues Jacinto](https://sites.google.com/site/joaquinrj/home) and [Ramiro Lafuente](https://sites.google.com/view/ramlaf/home). We qualified to the ACM--ICPC World Finals twice, in 2009 (Stockholm) and 2010 (Harbin). I've also ocassionally participated in [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/fidels), [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/fidels), CodeJam, HackerCup, and other individual programming competitions. After retiring as a contestant, I moved on to problem-setting and jury duties both at the [Argentinian](http://torneoprogramacion.com.ar/) and Latin-American regional level of ACM--ICPC.

- I am (slowly) adding some of the problems and solutions I used to practice, as well as problems I wrote myself, to [this repository](https://github.com/fidel-schaposnik/icpc-solutions).
- You can find some of my lectures on various topics in competitive programming in my [teaching](/teaching/) page.

## Mathematica problems

In 2019 I prepared some problems aiming to introduce Mathematica and improve the coding skills of people with a Physics background but not necessarily experienced in functional programming. While the Wolfram language has changed significantly since then, you may still find something useful in the following:
