    title    = {Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz past turning points: the (elliptic) sinh-Gordon model},
    abstract = {We analyze the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) for various integrable S-matrices in the context of generalized TTbar deformations. We focus on the sinh-Gordon model and its elliptic deformation in both its fermionic and bosonic realizations. We confirm that the determining factor for a turning point in the TBA, interpreted as a finite Hagedorn temperature, is the difference between the number of bound states and resonances in the theory. Implementing the numerical pseudo-arclength continuation method, we are able to follow the solutions to the TBA equations past the turning point all the way to the ultraviolet regime. We find that for any number k of resonances the pair of complex conjugate solutions below the turning point is such that the effective central charge is minimized. As k → ∞ the UV effective central charge goes to zero as in the elliptic sinh-Gordon model. Finally we uncover a new family of UV complete integrable theories defined by the bosonic counterparts of the S-matrices describing the Φ(1,3) integrable deformation of non-unitary minimal models M(2,2n+3).},

On the field theory side, this gravity background corresponds to a sudden quench which leads to the thermalization of the strongly-coupled dual conformal field theory. We find the time-dependent extremal volume surface by numerically solving a partial differential equation with boundary condition given by the Hubeny--Rangamani--Takayanagi surface, and we use this solution to compute holographic subregion complexity as a function of time. Approximate analytical expressions valid at early and at late times are derived.},

    title    = {Phases Of Melonic Quantum Mechanics},
    abstract = {We explore in detail the properties of two melonic quantum mechanical theories which can be formulated either as fermionic matrix quantum mechanics in the new large D limit, or as disordered models. Both models have a mass parameter m and the transition from the perturbative large m region to the strongly coupled "black-hole" small m region is associated with several interesting phenomena. One model, with U(n)^2 symmetry and equivalent to complex SYK, has a line of first-order phase transitions terminating, for a strictly positive temperature, at a critical point having non-trivial, non-mean-field critical exponents for standard thermodynamical quantities. Quasi-normal frequencies, as well as Lyapunov exponents associated with out-of-time-ordered four-point functions, are also singular at the critical point, leading to interesting new critical exponents. The other model, with reduced U(n) symmetry, has a quantum critical point at strictly zero temperature and positive critical mass m∗. For 0 < m < m∗, it flows to a new gapless IR fixed point, for which the standard scale invariance is spontaneously broken by the appearance of distinct scaling dimensions ∆+ and ∆− for the Euclidean two-point function when t → +∞ and t → −∞ respectively. We provide several detailed and pedagogical derivations, including rigorous proofs or simplified arguments for some results that were already known in the literature.},

    abstract = {We compute the phase diagram of a U(N)^2×O(D) invariant fermionic planar matrix quantum mechanics [equivalently tensor or complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models] in the new large D limit, dominated by melonic graphs. The Schwinger-Dyson equations can have two solutions describing either a high entropy, SYK black-hole-like phase, or a low entropy one with trivial IR behavior. In the strongly coupled region of the mass-temperature plane, there is a line of first order phase transitions between the high and low entropy phases. This line terminates at a new critical point which we study numerically in detail. The critical exponents are nonmean field and differ on the two sides of the transition. We also study purely bosonic unstable and stable melonic models. The former has a line of Kazakov critical points beyond which the Schwinger-Dyson equations do not have a consistent solution. Moreover, in both models the would-be SYK-like solution of the IR limit of the equations does not exist in the full theory.},

We find the holographic D3-brane description for Wilson loops with internal cusps in two different limits: small cusp angle and k λ^½ ≫ N. This allows for a non-trivial check of a conjectured relation between the Bremsstrahlung function and the expectation value of the ½ BPS circular loop in the case of a representation other than the fundamental. Moreover, we observe that in the limit of k ≫ N, the cusped Wilson line expectation value is simply given by the exponential of the 1-loop diagram. Using group theory arguments, this eikonal exponentiation is conjectured to take place for all Wilson loop operators in symmetric representations with large k, independently of the contour on which they are supported.},

The algorithm is also highly capable of solving the obstacle avoidance Steiner tree problem and is a strong alternative to the current leading algorithm.
